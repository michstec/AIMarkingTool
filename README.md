# AIMarkingTool
This repository contains the Final Year Project created by Michal Stec.
This repository also contains files for mock runs of the system to test its functionalities.

In order to be able to run the software it is required that you have a working version of a Python 3.7 installed on your computer.
Also the $Path variable of your system have to be pointing to the python. Refer to this link on how to do it: https://geek-university.com/python/add-python-to-the-windows-path/

Morover, there are certain packages that need to be installed in order to run the software. Namely, NLTK and Munkres:

2. https://pypi.org/project/munkres/1.0.5.4/#files
